             <b> Dr. Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai</b> (12 August 1919 – 30 December 1971)
              was an Indian physicist and astronomer who initiated space
              research and helped develop nuclear power in India. He was
              honoured with Padma Bhushan in 1966 and the Padma Vibhushan
              (posthumously) in 1972. He is internationally regarded as the
             <b> Father of the Indian Space Program </b>.[2][3][4][5] He was also a
              close friend of Homi Jehangir Bhabha, considered the father of
              India's Nuclear program.

          Early life and education
        </h3>
        <ul class="py-4">
          <li>
            1) <b>Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai</b> was born on August 12, 1919 at Ahmedabad
            in an affluent family of progressive industrialists. <b>Vikram Ambalal
            Sarabhai </b> was one of eight children of Ambalal and the Sarla Devi.
          </li>
          <li>
            2) Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai had his early education in a private
            school, “Retreat” run by his parents on Montessori lines.
          </li>
          <li>
            3) After his matriculation, Vikram Sarabhai proceeded to Cambridge
            for his college education and took the tripos in Natural Sciences
            from St. John’s college in 1940.
          </li>
          <li>
            4) When World War II began, Vikram Sarabhai returned home and joined
            as a research scholar under Sir C. V. Raman at the Indian Institute
            of Science, Bangalore His interest in solar physics and cosmic ray
            led him to set up many observation stations around the country

        <ul class="py-4">
          <li>
            1) The intellectual from famous Dr. Vikram Sarabhai Family of India
            who were the leading Industrialists and actively participated in
            Indian Independence Movement. After completion of his graduation he
            went to Cambridge for further studies.
          </li>
          <li>
            2) Soon after he returned from Cambridge to an independent India in
            1947, Vikram Sarabhai led charitable trusts controlled by his
            friends and family to finance a research institution near his
            residence in Ahmedabad. In the ongoing process Vikram Sarabhai
            established the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad in
            the year 1947.
          </li>
          <li>
            3) Vikram Sarabhai was very young and just 28 by that time. Sarabhai
            was the one who invented the pursuing of institutions and PRL was
            the initial step in that direction. Vikram Sarabhai served of PRL
            from 1966-1971.
          </li>
          <li>
            4) The invention of the
            <strong>Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) </strong>was one
            of his greatest find. Vikram Sarabhai successfully made government
            believe the importance of a space program for a developing country
            like India.

          The evolution of scientist
        </h3>
        <ul class="py-4">
          <li>
            The kind of interest that <b>Vikram Sarabhai </b>has shown in science and
            his implementation of research works in time variation mechanism in
            cosmic rays required a lot of instrumentation to observe the
            changing trends. Vikram Sarabhai with his group of students started
            constructing and setting up a huge number of cosmic ray telescopes
            for an undisturbed continuous observation of changing trends in the
            cosmic radiation and the intensity of the ray using the Geiger
            Muller counter telescopes in different places like Kodaikanal,
            Gulmarg and Trivendrum apart from Ahmedabad.
          </li>
          <br /><br /><br />
          <li>
            In the year 1957, the deep driving desire and his great interest in
            science naturally led him to take out the nitiation for the dynamic
            space program in India which was in the evolving phase of space
            studies and research in the world and in this process the PLR was
            made the cradle of Indian space programming. Vikram Sarabhai died on
            31st December 1971 of a heart attack due to heavy stress.

          <li>
            The establishment of the
            <b> Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)</b> was one of his
            greatest achievements. He successfully convinced the government of
            the importance of a space programme for a developing country like
            India after the Russian, Sputnik launch.
            <b> Dr. Vikram Sarabhai </b> emphasized the importance of a space
            program in his references.
          </li>
          <br /><br />
          <li>
            Dr. Homi Jehangir Bhabha, widely regarded as the father of India’s
            nuclear science program, supported <b>Dr. Vikram Sarabhai </b> in
            setting up the first rocket launching station in India. This center
            was established at Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram on the coast of
            the Arabian Sea, primarily because of its proximity to the equator.
            After a remarkable effort in setting up the infrastructure,
            personnel, communication links, and launch pads, the inaugural
            flight was launched on November 21, 1963 with a sodium vapour
            payload.
          </li>
          <br /><br />
          <li>
            Dr. Vikram Sarabhai started a project for the fabrication and launch
            of an Indian Satellite. As a result, the first Indian satellite,
            Aryabhata, was put in orbit in 1975 from a Russian Cosmodrome.
          </li>
          <br /><br />
          <li>
            Dr Vikram Sarabhai established many institutes which are of
            international repute. Most notable among them are IIMs Indian
            Institute Of Management which are considered world class for their
            management studies. Also he helped establishing
            <b> PRL (Physical Research Laboratory) </b> which is doing
            commendable job in R&D in Physics. Dr Vikram Sarabhai setup
            <b>ATIRA (Ahmedabad Textiles Industrial Research Association) </b>
            which helped the booming textiles business in Ahmedabad. Dr Vikram
            Sarabhai also setup
            <b> CEPT (Center for Environmental Planning and Technology) </b>.
            Not stopping with all these he went ahead and setup
            <b>BMA (Blind Men Association) </b> which helps visually challenged
            people with necessary skills and support.

            vehicle development located in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum),
            capital of Kerala state, is named in his memory. Along with other
            Ahmedabad-based industrialists, he played a major role in setting up
            of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. In 1973, the
            International Astronomical Union decided that a lunar crater, Bessel
            A, in the Sea of Serenity will be known as the
            <b>Sarabhai </b>crater.

            his departure for Bombay the same night. He had spoken to A. P. J.
            Abdul Kalam on the telephone. Within an hour of the conversation,
            Sarabhai died at the age of 52 due to cardiac arrest in Trivandrum
